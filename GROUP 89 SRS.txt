        All the hardware shall require to connect to internet will be hardware interface for the system.
		e.g. modem,  WAN, LAN
		Specialized Server Infrastructure Hardware
        The system should use distrubuted servers i.e cloud for managing large amount of data so as to make it appear as single unit for end-user.
        The system should have proper clusters for backup.

Software Interface:
===================

        At the end-user need web browser for interact with the system.

	Technology used: Web based Java(J2EE)
	Web server: Apache supplied Tomcat.
	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JAVA Script, Angular (SPA)
	Hardware interface: windows 10
	Database: MYSQL 
	
Performance Requirement:
=======================
	There is no  performance requirement in this system, because the server request  and respone to client is totally based on internet connection of enduser.
			
Design Constrains:
==================
	This system should be developed using  Standard Web Page Development Tool , which conforms GUI standards such like HTML, XML, JSON,etc.
        The system should support various RDMS and Cloud Technologies.

Non-Functional Requirements:
============================
1.Performance requirements:
	The system need to be reliable
	If unable to process the request then appropriate error message
	Web pages are loaded within few seconds
2.Safety Requirements:
	The details need to be maintained properly
	Users must be authenticated
	The database must be kept backed up
3.Security Requirements:
	After entering the password and user id the user can access his profile
	The details of user must be safe and secure
	Sharing of details 

4. Maintainability:
	A commercial database is used for maintaining the databae and application server takes care of the site. 
	The maintainability can be done efficiently.

5.Portability:
	The application is HTML and scripting language based (Javascript). So the end user part is fully portable and any system using 
	any web browser should be able to use the features of the system,including any hardware platform that is available 
	or will be available in the futuer. 
	An end-user  is used this system on an OS;either it is Windows or Linux.
	The System shall run on PC, Laptops and PDA.etc.
	The  technology should be transferable to different environments easily.

6.Accessibility:
        Only registered users should be allowed to process the orders after authentications.
        Only GUI access of the system should be permited to end users.

7.Policies:
       The system should adhere to all the legal formalities of the particular countries.
       The system should maintain security related to sensitive data.

8.Efficiency:
	The system should provide good throughput and response to multiple users without burdening the system by using appropriate number of servers.

9.Safety:
      Software should not harm ethical and environmental conditions of the end users machine.

10.Modulariy:
      The system should have user friendly interface. 
      It should be easily updated,modified and reused. 

Operational Scenario:
=====================
